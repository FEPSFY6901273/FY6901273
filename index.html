 <pre class="ex1" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
    Advancements of photogrammetry, computer softwares and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), it is the future of solving cold
    cases, involving unidentifiable victims. This article explores the potential of using drone technology to accurately
    capture and reform a human face during crime scene investigations and hopefully paving the way for a precise
    identification to bring closure to their families and serve justice to the victims. Traditionally, before advanced
    technology emerged, forensic investigators would use clay to form the face of the victims, however this would be placed
    directly onto their skull, an extremely invasive way to find out their characteristics and probably frowned upon by many
    peers in the industry. However, this newer technology provides a non-invasive approach from gathering data all the way
    to developing facial features. As technology evolves, new accurate methods would be introduced, such as laser scanning,
    to completely eliminate the chance of human error.

 <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
 
 <pre class="ex1" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
    <p id="Introduction1">
    Photogrammetry is "the technique of using photographs to ascertain measurements of what is photographed" <a href="#(Oxford Dictionary, 2023)">(Oxford Dictionary, 2023)</a>
    , a vital element to solving criminal investigations and decreasing the possibility of cold cases. The
    "ascertained measurements" extracted from photographs can then be designed into a computer 3D model, in this case it
    gives investigators an insight on the layout of the crime scene from multiple perspectives, perhaps introducing a new
    lead in the investigation. Thus, the main form of photogrammetry consists of Micro UAV (Micro Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle)<a href="#(PS and Jeyan, 2020)">(PS and Jeyan, 2020)</a> technology which allows machinery such as drones to take measurements and scans for you.
    Ultimately, launching Micro UAV technology at the crime scene enables the site to be protected from damage and be
    preserved whilst the case is still active, and if the case needs to be re-examined in the future <a href="#(Sazaly, 2022)">(Sazaly, 2022)</a>.
    </p>

 <h3 id="Photogrammetry?">What is Photogrammetry?</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
   <pre class="ex2" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id="Photogrammetry">
    Ultimately, there are 5 processes that make up a 3D model using photogrammetry which include data collection, image
    alignment, point cloud generation, mesh creation and texturing <a href="#(Farhadi, 2024)">(Farhadi, 2024)</a>. Data is normally collected using cameras
    or drones such as Micro UAV to collect a variety of photographs of the scene with 60%- 80% overlapping so that during
    the image alignment the software can detect common features across all the images. Thus, in the cloud, a point is
    assigned to each part of the image and therefore corresponds to a certain point in the crime scene to make 3D
    coordinates. These coordinates are used to create a mesh, once created they apply the photos and should end up looking
    like the original model <a href="#(Farhadi, 2024)">(Farhadi, 2024)</a>. Correspondingly, this will increase the efficiency of the models as it is all
    done on a computer software and therefore minimises the risk for human error during manual measurements processes.
    Additionally, the ethical issues around photogrammetry are minimal due to the non invasive nature of data collection,
    especially at crime scenes. However, there will always be issues with potential vulnerability and discussions around
    anonymity <a href="#(Tremlett, 2024)">(Tremlett, 2024)</a> as there is nobody to consent to the photographs being taken of their personal residents or
    their dead being.

 <h3 id="UAVs">Introduction to UAVs</h3>
 
 <p>
 <pre class="ex3" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id="Para3">
     Evidently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) have been adapted for forensic science by making them smaller so they can fit
     through gaps, however they use them at crime scenes because they are efficient, easy to transport and provide the
     results they need for the 3D photogrammetry analysis. Comparatively, UAVs otherwise known as drones, have widely been
     adopted in forensic investigations, however there is still limited evidence "regarding categorisations of drone
     applications" <a href="#(Sabri, 2023)">(Sabri, 2023)</a>. The Micro UAVs are approximately 16x2.5 cm and can easily be held between two fingers
     <a href="#(Dean, 2023)">(Dean, 2023)</a> which makes them perfect for transporting and manoeuvring between the crime scenes and labs to extract the
     photos the drone has taken, to start the photogrammetry process. However, in challenging environments such as low light
     the photographs may not be clear enough for the software to identify or in high winds, where the drone might not even be
     able to stay in flight, perhaps even leading to a damaged UAVs.

 <h3 id="Human_Face">3D Reconstruction of a Human Face</h3>
 <p>
 <pre class="ex4" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id="3D_Reconstruction">
    Before photogrammetry existed, clay was originally placed over the skull and from there they would reform the face by
    taking educated guesses of the facial structure. Additionally, to start the reconstruction the skull is placed in the
    "Frankfurt horizontal plane" which mimics the natural position of a human head at rest and then several points are
    placed on the face, which can be seen in step B in Figure 3 <a href="#(Houlton, 2022)">(Houlton, 2022)</a>.

    <img src="Figure3.png" alt="Figure3" height="200px" width="500">
    <p>Figure 3. <a href="#(Houlton, 2022)">(Houlton, 2022)</a></p>


    Comparatively, at Ohio State University, researchers used a software called "Mesh" which is usually used for video
    games, to take a clay structure and turn it into a tool to develop different facial characteristics <a href="#(Botley, 2023)">(Botley, 2023)</a>,
    however our photogrammetry using UAV will work in the same way, by taking hundreds of pictures to form the human skull,
    and layer a variety of characteristics on top of there reconstructed face to identify victims. This provides many
    identifications of what the victims might have looked like and eventually the more photogrammetry software develops, it
    increases the likelihood of victims from cold cases being identified <a href="#(Molnar, 2023)">(Molnar, 2023)</a>. Additionally, photogrammetry is
    being used as a reliable method to identify the sex through human skulls including age estimation, bite marks and soft
    tissue, which were once difficult to produce using traditional forensic techniques <a href="#(Silva, 2023)">(Silva, 2023)</a>, allowing investigators
    to identify the once unidentifiable victims efficiently and accurately.
 </pre>
 </p>

 <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
 <pre class="ex5" style="font-size: 15px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" id="Conclusion_InText">
    Therefore, Micro UAV photogrammetry offers significant potential in criminal investigations by recrafting 3D models of
    human faces that aid identifying victims during cold cases. Hopefully, as technology advances these systems will improve
    offering more efficient and accurate methods to solve these demanding issues.
